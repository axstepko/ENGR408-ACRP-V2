   abstract = {With the current advances in aircraft design and Lithium-Ion batteries, electric aircraft are expected to serve as a replacement for conventional, short-range aircraft. This paper addresses the main operational challenges for short-range flights operated with electric aircraft: determining the investment needs for a fleet of electric aircraft, and the logistics of charging stations and swap batteries required to support these flights. A mixed-integer linear program with two phases is proposed. In the first phase, a schedule for flight and battery recharge is developed for a fleet of electric aircraft. In the second phase, optimal times for battery charging are determined, together with an optimal sizing of the number of charging stations and swap batteries. We illustrate our model for short-range flights to and from an European airport and for an electric aircraft designed based on the operational characteristics of a conventional, narrow-body aircraft.},

   abstract = {Laboratory-size LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2/graphite lithium-ion pouch cells were cycled over 100\% DOD at room temperature and 60°C in order to investigate high-temperature degradation mechanisms of this important technology. Capacity fade for the cell was correlated with that for the individual components, using electrochemical analysis of the electrodes and other diagnostic techniques. The high-temperature cell lost 65\% of its initial capacity after 140 cycles at 60°C compared to only a 4\% loss for the cell cycled at room temperature. Cell ohmic impedance increased significantly with a elevated temperature cycling, resulting in some of loss of capacity at the C/2 rate. However, as determined with slow rate testing of the individual electrodes, the anode retained most of its original capacity, while the cathode lost 65\%, even when cycled with a fresh source of lithium. Diagnostic evaluation of cell components including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, CSAFM and suggest capacity loss occurs primarily due to a rise in the impedance of the cathode, especially at the end-of-charge. The impedance rise may be caused in part by a loss of the conductive carbon at the surface of the cathode and/or by an organic film on the surface of the cathode that becomes non-ionically conductive at low lithium content.},

   abstract = {Electric propulsion for commuter air transportation is a promising technology because of significant strides in battery specific energy and motor specific power. Energy storage and rapid battery recharge remain nonetheless challenging owing to the significant energy and power requirements of even small aircraft. By modifying algorithms developed in the field of scheduling theory, we propose power optimized and power-investment optimized strategies for electric aircraft battery swaps and recharges. Several aspects are considered: electric energy expenditures, capital expenditures, and flight schedule integrity. The first strategy optimizes the swaps and recharges to minimize the peak-power draw from the grid and reduce electric energy expenditures. The second strategy optimizes the swaps and recharges to minimize electricity expenditures and capital expenditures associated with battery and charger procurement. In both cases, the optimization is decomposed into two steps. The first step determines the combinations of numbers of chargers and batteries that yield a feasible recharge schedule. It is based on a network flow representation of the battery swap and recharge. The second step builds a recharge schedule for the previously determined numbers of chargers and batteries. Together, they enable the estimation of peak power demand, electric expenditures, and capital expenditures used to implement the power optimized and power-investment optimized strategies. Both strategies are applied to the operations of two commuter airlines and are contrasted with a benchmark non-optimized power-as-needed strategy. Promising results are obtained with up to 61\% reduction in peak-power draw and up to 25\% reduction in electricity costs.},

   abstract = {For several years, the UAV market had been in the nascent phase, facing a lack of adoption in the commercial sector. Although they were initially viewed as military devices, drones have established a significant presence in the commercial sector over the past five years. Over the years, with several new exemptions from governing bodies, like FAA and EASA, the demand for UAVs has emerged from various industries, like infrastructure, agriculture, transport, entertainment, security, and insurance.
Advancements in UAV flight technologies have allowed manufacturers to produce a wide range of models in different sizes, weights, and shapes, which can carry different sensor payloads, making them favorable across a broad application base.
However, factors such as the power limitations of batteries, and associated safety concerns with UAVs are anticipated to restrict the growth of the E-UAV market to a certain extent.},
